# Identity_Scence_Detection
There are fixed cameras over the conveyor belt, on the conveyor belt artifacts will be sent and taken pictures. 
If the artifact has a new shape/contour, it needs a manual shape/contour marking to further the welding process.
The artifacts that are being sent could be in different positions and rotated.
Determine if the sent artifact is new or not.
